URL: https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/api-testing/api-testing-api-documentation/api-testing/lab-exploiting-api-endpoint-using-documentation

## Description

To solve the lab, find the exposed API documentation and delete `carlos`. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`.

## Solution

1. Login with `wiener:peter` then try to change the email address and intercept the request, you'll get the following:

   ![api-docs](/assets/api-docs.png)

2. Send to repeater, change the method to `GET`, path to `/api/`, remove the body then send the request, you'll get the documentation page as following:

   ![api-docs-1](/assets/api-docs-1.png)

3. As the documentation said, change the request method to `DELETE` and path to `/api/user/carlos`, `carlos` should be deleted and the challenge is solved.
